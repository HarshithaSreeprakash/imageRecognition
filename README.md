# imageRecognition
This is a simple first step code to get into image recognition using neural networks.

This program consists of only 6 pieces of code to build a neural network. Here, we use the classic MNIST dataset of handwritten images as the input, and output the number that is in the handwritten digit. The process can be described shortly as Input -> TensorFlow Model -> Output.

Step1: Import the library TensorFlow
Step2: Import the MNIST dataset
Step3: Stacking layers of neural network (input layer, hidden layer, output layer)
Step4: Train the model (simple as a single line model.fit)
Step5: Evaluate the model on the testing dataset
Step6: Ready to deploy
