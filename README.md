# imageRecognition
This is a simple first step code to get into image recognition using neural networks.<br/>

This program consists of only 6 pieces of code to build a neural network. Here, we use the classic MNIST dataset of handwritten images as the input, and output the number that is in the handwritten digit. <br/> The process can be described shortly as Input -> TensorFlow Model -> Output.

Step1: Import the library TensorFlow <br/>
Step2: Import the MNIST dataset <br/>
Step3: Stacking layers of neural network (input layer, hidden layer, output layer) <br/>
Step4: Train the model (simple as a single line model.fit) <br/>
Step5: Evaluate the model on the testing dataset <br/>
Step6: Ready to deploy <br/>
